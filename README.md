What is this Project?

This open source project came derived from need of having programatic integration with Dropbox directly (not through sync services). This project is a work in progress as I am not implemented every API call in the Dropbox Core API to start. 

This project's flow is based on popping an HTMLViewer to ask the user to allow authorization to link your app to their   account (oAuth2.0). Once this auth is complete you can make any Core APi calls that are implemented in this SDK programatically or by way of UI dialogs.

What type of an implementation did you use?

    I used the Dropbox Core API RESTful implementation using oAuth 2.0
    
Supported Dropbox Core API Calls:

    /oauth2/authorize - OAuth 2.0 authorization flow
    /account/info - Retrieves information about the user's account
    /files_put - Uploads a file using PUT semantics
    /fileops/create_folder - Creates a folder
    /fileops/delete - Deletes a folder
    /delta - A way of letting you keep up with changes to files and folders in a user's Dropbox
    /revisions - Only revisions up to thirty days old are available (or more if the Dropbox user has Packrat).
    
    
How do I get started using it?

    This project is a self functioning demonstration that is designed to test your Dropbox developer App.
    The demo window uses buttons to make first authorize and then make the API calls using a dynamic object 
    class structure.
    
What do I need from Dropbox to get this to work?

    1. You will need to setup a development account - https://www.dropbox.com/developers
    2. You will need to create a Dropbox app using the App Console - https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps
    3. READ the Dropbox Developer Branding Guide! - https://www.dropbox.com/developers/reference/branding
    
Future version releases?

    This is an open source project and I will be adding to this implementation with more Core API calls as
    time permits.
    
I found a bug, what now?
